        Hi, My name is Samuel Mutiso and I am currently majoring in information management & Technology at Syracuse university. I am currently interested in data security and also I have an interest in becoming a web developer. I have taken courses at Syracuse like ist 233 and 256 that have given me a strong background in computers and coding. Outside of academics I am an athlete at Syracuse university who runs track and field. Im interested in fashion, I like to watch TV shows like Power and Snowfall and I grew up in Boston, Mass.
